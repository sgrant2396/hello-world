Scratch Work Repository
This is my sample repository that serves two purposes:
1. To teach me how to use Github
2. To create a repository where I can write pieces of sample code

For help with using Github through a terminal visit: https://github.com/codepath/ios_guides/wiki/Using-Git-with-Terminal
